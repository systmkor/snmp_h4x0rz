\section{Scenario}
As SNMP is commonly used to manage complex network resources, maintaining 
such a system is something that a small company may wish to outsource to a 
third party IT company.  This company would likely have a direct VPN to 
access the SNMP servers and clients running on the remote system, which we 
will emulate as described below. The goal of this project is to highlight 
the insecurites of the SNMP protocol, its common configurations and its 
negative effects of being a part of management systems 
(.e.g a hardware management system).

\section{Goal}
We plan to implement a proof of concept of a known  Simple Network Management 
Protocol (SNMP) vulnerability over multiple anonymous systems. If there is enough time
we would like to find and implement a SNMP vulnerability of our own.

\section{Known SNMP Vulnerability} %WE NEED AN ACTUALLY KNOWN SNMP vuln
What the SNMP vulnerability is. 
Where we found it.

\section{Setup and Logistics}
In an overal structure for the completition of this project
we will need 3 main factors to be able to complete the project.
We need the Network setup, SNMP Servers and Clients and the
our written tools to actively exploit the vulnerabilities in
SNMP.

\subsection{Network}
In this project, we hope to create a network involving 3 autonomous 
systems [see figure].  We will configure a middle AS as a transit   %% add figure link
network, and run a VPN between the other two through it.

\begin{figure}

  \caption{Proposed Network Topology}
\end{figure}

\subsection{SNMP}
Over this VPN, we will run the SNMP protocol, which has known 
implementation vulnerabilities as of SNMPv3. On the “IT” AS, we will 
run a server tasked with managing resources of the devices on our 
“Client” AS.  These resources will probably be things such as ink 
levels in a printer, or other easy to generate resources.

\subsection{Attacks}
When we attempt to exploit SNMP vulnerabilities, we will perform our 
attacks from several topological locations in our network.  The most 
obvious first place to try would be in either the “Client” or “IT” AS; 
however, we would also like to show results for attempts made from 
the “ISP” AS and other external locations.
