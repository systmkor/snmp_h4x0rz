As far as I can tell, when I set the servers up, things are being set.
However, currently the only things being monitored are
/home/ramrod/sizefile
the bash process (which doesnt seem to work)

Note you have to adjust the arch linux settings



Note that you will have to change IP addresses.
This file is intended for the /usr/share/snmp directory of the archlinux 
client.
ALSO.
If the user is not initialized:
1: Stop the running snmpd
2: Remove all text from /var/net-snmp/snmpd.conf
3: Add the line "createUser ramrod MD5 calpoly1 DES calpoly1"

Thats all I can currently think of. Goodnight, and good luck.
