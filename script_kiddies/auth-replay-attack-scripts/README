This file describes sniff_and_spew.py and cappy.py

First, we run cappy.py.
Next, we perform an snmpget over this network.
Next, we close cappy.py.
Next we should open wireshark, start a capture, and run
sniff_and_spew.py.
Finally, we can see the response packet in Wireshark.

Since it already formats it, I didn't see a reason to reduplicate this effor.t


So yeah, thats about it. Keep in mind IP's may need to change. ETC.
